```Simple Snake Game Using Ebiten```
Overview:
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game written in Go using the Ebiten game library.
The game follows a minimalist design with simple logic, focusing on core gameplay mechanics without complex features.
The player controls a snake that moves across a grid, eats food to grow longer, and avoids colliding with itself.
The game is rendered in a 2D window with basic graphics, using a white background, a green snake, and (optionally) red food.
